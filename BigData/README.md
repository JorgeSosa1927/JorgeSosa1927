# Big Data


This folder contains my Big Data projects, where I work with scalable data processing, analytics, and real-time data streaming solutions. The projects here demonstrate my ability to handle large volumes of data using modern tools and frameworks.

## Contents:
- **Project_Progress:** Contains the first progress update for the JobMarket Analysis Project, which focuses on exploring the Russian job market by extracting, cleaning, and processing data from various sources.
- *(Additional subfolders for other Big Data projects can be added here.)*

## Overview:
In these projects, I build data pipelines and apply advanced processing techniques to transform massive datasets into actionable insights. The work includes developing batch processing scripts, using APIs for data extraction, and setting up the necessary infrastructure for robust Big Data analysis.

Stay tuned for further updates and new project additions as I continue to explore the Big Data domain!
