# Multivariate Data Analysis Project

This project showcases a comprehensive multivariate analysis performed on a dataset using various advanced statistical techniques. The project is documented through a series of detailed laboratory reports and interactive Jupyter Notebooks.

## Project Structure:
- **Reports:** Detailed PDF documents explaining the methodology, data exploration, cleaning, transformation, advanced analysis (including PCA, t-SNE, UMAP, factor analysis), and final model evaluation.
  - **Lab1.pdf:** Overview of data cleaning, transformation, and initial model results.
  - **Lab2.pdf:** In-depth analysis using advanced multivariate methods.
  - **Lab3.pdf:** Statistical analysis, model selection, evaluation metrics, and conclusions.
- **Notebooks:** Interactive Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb) containing the complete code and step-by-step analysis.
  - Organized further into subfolders if needed (e.g., Notebooks/ for the analysis code).

## How to Run:
- Open the notebooks using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/).
- Ensure all necessary dependencies are installed (refer to `requirements.txt` if available).
- Follow the instructions provided within each notebook to reproduce the analysis.

## Additional Information:
- The reports complement the notebooks by offering detailed context, visualizations, and explanations of the analytical process.
- It is recommended to start with Lab1 and proceed sequentially through Lab2 and Lab3 to get a complete understanding of the project workflow.
