# Notebooks

This folder contains the Jupyter Notebooks for the Titanic Machine Learning Project. These notebooks provide the interactive code and detailed analysis steps, including:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Model training and evaluation.
- Hyperparameter tuning and model comparison.

## How to Use:
- Open the notebooks using [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
- Follow the sequential order of the analysis to understand the project workflow.
- Ensure all necessary dependencies are installed before running the notebooks.

Each notebook is designed to guide you through the process of building and evaluating predictive models for Titanic passenger survival.
