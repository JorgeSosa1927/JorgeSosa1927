# Titanic Machine Learning Project

This project focuses on predicting the survival of Titanic passengers using various machine learning algorithms. The project follows a structured approach that includes data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and comparative analysis.

## Project Structure:
- **Notebooks/**: Contains interactive Jupyter Notebooks with the full code and step-by-step analysis.
- **Reports/**: Includes the detailed project report in PDF format.
- **Data/** (Optional): Can be used to store datasets if needed.

## How to Run:
- Open the notebooks using [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
- Make sure to install the required dependencies (see `requirements.txt` if available).
- Follow the instructions within the notebooks to reproduce the analysis.

## Overview:
- **Objective:** Predict the survival outcome of Titanic passengers.
- **Approach:** Comparison of multiple machine learning models, including gradient boosting, decision trees, and neural networks.
- **Key Outcomes:** Detailed evaluation of models, hyperparameter tuning, and analysis of variable importance.
