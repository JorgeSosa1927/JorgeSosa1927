## 🗂️ Projects Overview

### 📊 Data Analysis  
**[McDonald's Multivariate Analysis](./DataAnalysis/Análisis_Multivariable_de_McDonalds)**  
This project delivers a comprehensive analysis of McDonald's menu data to predict calorie content. It covers rigorous data cleaning, transformation, and the use of advanced techniques like PCA and clustering (t-SNE/UMAP) to reveal key nutritional patterns. Detailed lab reports, including Lab3 (which focuses on statistical analysis, model selection, and evaluation), document every step of the process.

### 🤖 Machine Learning  
**[Titanic Machine Learning Project](./MachineLearning/Titanic_Project)**  
This project predicts Titanic passenger survival using various machine learning algorithms on the Kaggle Titanic dataset. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation, comparing classifiers such as KNN, SVC, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, and MLP. Comprehensive experiments and statistical tests identify the best model, all documented in a detailed report.

### 🧠 Deep Learning  
**[Class Recognition Project – Memorándum 9494](https://github.com/Memo9494/classrecon_team1_TC3007C.501)**  
Team project developed as part of TC3007C.501 at Tecnológico de Monterrey. It consists of a real-time class recognition system that uses deep learning and computer vision to automate student attendance and participation tracking. The system combines face recognition (via ResNet-based models), pose detection (YOLOv8-Pose), and a Django web platform with PostgreSQL for data management. Designed for educational environments, it enables professors to monitor participation and attendance through a dashboard, reducing manual effort while maintaining accuracy and scalability.

### 💾 Big Data  
**[Russian Job Market Analysis (Coming Soon)](./BigData/)**  
This project is currently under development. It aims to explore the Russian job market by analyzing data from various employment platforms. The goal is to extract insights from job listings and candidate profiles, identify regional trends and in-demand skills, and use NLP techniques to uncover key industry dynamics specific to Russia.

### 🇷🇺 Research Project (Master’s in AI – Russia)  
**Epidemic Modeling on Multilayer Networks**

- 📄 [Part 1 – Theoretical Research](./Research%20Project/Part1): Literature review and academic presentation  
- 🧪 [Part 2 – Network Simulations](./Research%20Project/Part2): Epidemic simulation on multilayer networks with stochastic modeling

This research project was developed as part of the Master’s in Artificial Intelligence in Russia. It simulates the spread of epidemics on complex multilayer networks, incorporating stochastic processes, temporal dynamics in social interactions, and individual heterogeneity. The model enables the study of contagion scenarios and the evaluation of intervention strategies based on realistic social configurations.
