# Epidemic Modeling on Multilayer Networks

ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º **Research Project (Masterâ€™s in AI â€“ Russia)**

This project is divided into two parts:

- **Part 1 â€“ Theoretical Research:** Literature review and project presentation on classical and network-based epidemic models.
- **Part 2 â€“ Network Simulations:** Computational implementation of epidemic models on multilayer networks.

Each section contains its own documentation and materials.
